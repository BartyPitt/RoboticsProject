def flip(m, axis=None):
    """
    Reverse the order of elements in an array along the given axis.
    The shape of the array is preserved, but the elements are reordered.
    .. versionadded:: 1.12.0
    Parameters
    ----------
    m : array_like
        Input array.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
         Axis or axes along which to flip over. The default,
         axis=None, will flip over all of the axes of the input array.
         If axis is negative it counts from the last to the first axis.
         If axis is a tuple of ints, flipping is performed on all of the axes
         specified in the tuple.
         .. versionchanged:: 1.15.0
            None and tuples of axes are supported
    Returns
    -------
    out : array_like
        A view of `m` with the entries of axis reversed.  Since a view is
        returned, this operation is done in constant time.
    See Also
    --------
    flipud : Flip an array vertically (axis=0).
    fliplr : Flip an array horizontally (axis=1).
    Notes
    -----
    flip(m, 0) is equivalent to flipud(m).
    flip(m, 1) is equivalent to fliplr(m).
    flip(m, n) corresponds to ``m[...,::-1,...]`` with ``::-1`` at position n.
    flip(m) corresponds to ``m[::-1,::-1,...,::-1]`` with ``::-1`` at all
    positions.
    flip(m, (0, 1)) corresponds to ``m[::-1,::-1,...]`` with ``::-1`` at
    position 0 and position 1.
