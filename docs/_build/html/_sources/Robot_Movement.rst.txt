Functional Overview
----------------------------------------


AddPosition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
::

	def AddPosition(self , PositionName , PositionCordinates):
			'''A setter function that sets up the positions for the robot to travel to'''
			self.__positions__[PositionName] = PositionCordinates

The function is designed to store a coordinate in cartesian form in a private dictionary. This function originally stored the variables in the form 
of a Moveit Pose class , this was later changed , as it is very difficult to both view the values as well as made it very difficult to modify the values.
The function remained partially to interact with legacy code, and partially as it was thought that it maybe useful to add in a sanitization layer.
