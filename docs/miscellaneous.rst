Documentation Instructions
---------------------------

This documentation has been created using the ``sphinx`` documentation generator.
For creating the documentation for this project, ``sphinx`` must be installed on your computer.
This can be done with:


.. code-block:: bash

    pip install sphinx             # for Windows
    apt-get install python-sphinx  # for Linux


You will also have to install ``recommonmark`` which can be done with:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install recommonmark       # for Windows
    apt-get install recommonmark   # for Linux

Lastly, ``sphinx_rtd_theme`` , the theme used here, should be installed.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install sphinx_rtd_theme


To compile and view your documentation, navigate to ``RoboticsProject/docs`` and open a terminal there. On your terminal, type in 


.. code-block:: bash

	make clean html

This should compile your .rst documentation files to html in the ``docs/_build/html`` folder. To view what the webpage will look like, navigate to the ``docs/_build/html`` folder and open ``index.html`` in your browser.

.. warning::

    If your ``make clean html`` command did not terminate successfully, you will not be able to find the ``docs/_build/html`` folder as it is generated by that command.

.. note::

    When you rebuild the html files with ``make clean html``, all you need to do is refresh your webbrowser to see the latest updated changes.
