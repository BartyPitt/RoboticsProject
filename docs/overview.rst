Overview
====================

In this project, we got the Franka Emika "panda" robot to play a game of Connect Four against a human. It integrates computer vision to detect moves by the human opponent and plans its move. The Robot then picks its token from a human handler and drops it in the right column that it chooses.

We carried out extensive simulations of the robot's motion using Gazebo for visualisation.


Here is a flow chart showing the steps the robot takes.
