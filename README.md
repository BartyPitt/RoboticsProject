# What needs to be done
# Stage 1
* Play a pre planned game according to a script where player and robot will follow the exact same game plan every time
* Hardcode all the moves into the robot using python scripts and perfect it

# Stage 2
* Add feed back control to the robot, allowing it to know whether it has successfully dropped the circular token in to the right spot
* IF not successful, try again

# Stage 3
* Make the robot aware of the state of the board( position of blue, yellow and empty spots)
* Make robot calculate the next best move
* Human plays competitively
